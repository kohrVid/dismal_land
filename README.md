Welcome to Dismaland!

We'd like to have a web app built from an existing very simple CLI app.  Check out the current implementation by running:

```
ruby dismaland.rb
```

Notice that from each location, you can go in various different ways to a new location.  It is always one of 8 different directions -- NW, N, NE, W, E, SW, S, or SE.

We've got a bunch of images saved in a folder that relate to all of these 28 locations, and invite you to create an appropriate Padrino app with at least two models -- one for the 28 locations, and one that describes all the ways you can navigate from a given place to a new one.

Style a web page that has the GIF image shown in the center, and has 8 buttons arranged around the image in each of the possible directions, and when clicked takes you to the next location.  Have the title of the place show in more bolded text, and the description in smaller text.

Have fun, be creative, and enjoy this cute little project :)
